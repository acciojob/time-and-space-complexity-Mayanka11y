	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

	<p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. It helps us understand how efficient an algorithm is, especially when dealing with large datasets. An algorithm with lower time complexity is generally more efficient and performs better.</p>

	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to run as a function of the input size. It is often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input. Understanding space complexity is crucial for optimizing memory usage in algorithms.</p>
